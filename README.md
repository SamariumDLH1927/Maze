# Maze
A fun game we played during our high school years, you can just try it and fell the fun. We actually played it in the classroom 1v1, that means two students compete with each other by using as few steps as possible to solve their oppenent's maze design.\n
Besides, I'm sorry for the language of the texts in the output of the programmes, because I wrote the games two years ago and used Chinese to explain it. Maybe you can use google translate to interpret the texts, or just waiting for my update of the programmes.
